This game is a simple platformer made in Java using the JGame engine for a Software Engineering class at the University of Arkansas.

To play, go to the Downloads tab (upper right corner under the Graphs tab) and download the Platformer Game.zip file.
After downloading, extract the folder, open it and double-click the Platformer.jar file. (This assumes you have JDK installed).

Have fun!
